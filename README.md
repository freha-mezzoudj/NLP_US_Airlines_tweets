# Natural Language Processing (NLP)- 

I have explored the Airlines tweets data base  using Histograms and world cloud!

I have applied a standard Naive Bayes classification on the 3 classes (positive, negative and neutral).

I have reported and executed (on colab) an advanced classifcation on the 3 classes using Naive Bayes (S. G. Sundari, M. A. Islam, 2020).

I have applied Sentimeny analysis V1 using LSTM only on 2 classes (positive and negative).
