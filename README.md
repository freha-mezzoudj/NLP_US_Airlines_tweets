# Natural Language Processing (NLP)-

I explore the Airlines tweets data base (Histograms and world cloud)!

I apply a Naive Bayes classification on the 3 classes (positive, negative and neutral).

I apply some NLP tasks, such as Sentimeny analysis V1 using LSTM only on 2 classes (positive and negative).
